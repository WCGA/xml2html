Total Population is the total number of residents in an area. Residence refers to the “usual place” where a person lives. Total Population for 2000 is from the U.S. Census 2000. Total Population for 1990 is from the 1990 U.S. Census adjusted to 2000 boundaries. The geography depicts states at greater than 25m scale, counties at 1m to 25m scale, Census Tracts at 250k to 1m scale, and Census Block Groups at less than 250k scale. The map has been designed to be displayed with semi-transparency of about 50% for overlay on other base maps, which is reflected in the legend for the map.
