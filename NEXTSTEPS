XSLT in the browser - promising
  FGDC works
  ISO/ISO2 kinda work but some issues
  DC did not seem to
  Implementing would require:
    resolving issues for each metadata types
    creating a wcodp page that takes a xml type and metadata url as parameters and renders the HTML
    add link to results view
    Pulls xml type from solr result - "sys.metadatatype.key_s": "iso19115-2"
